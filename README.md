### DC Motor Speed Control Using Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a DC motor speed control system using the TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) reinforcement learning algorithm. The project is simulated entirely in MATLAB and includes a comparative analysis with a traditional PID controller.

Project Overview

Objectives:
1. Develop a reinforcement learning model to control the speed of a DC motor.
2. Implement the TD3 algorithm for maintaining constant speed.
3. Compare the performance of the reinforcement learning model with a PID controller.
4. Highlight the advantages and challenges of using reinforcement learning for control systems.

Key Features:
1. TD3 Algorithm: Utilized for training the reinforcement learning model to achieve precise speed control.
2. Comparative Analysis: Detailed performance comparison between TD3 and PID controllers.
3. MATLAB Simulation: Comprehensive simulation environment to test and optimize the control strategies.

Requirements:
1. MATLAB (version 2019a or later)
2. Reinforcement Learning Toolbox
3. Control System Toolbox

Results
1. Accuracy: The TD3 algorithm achieved over 97% accuracy in maintaining the desired motor speed.
2. Adaptability: Demonstrated superior adaptability and precision in varying conditions compared to the PID controller.
3. Training Time: Highlighted the extensive training time required for reinforcement learning models.
